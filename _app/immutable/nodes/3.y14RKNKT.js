      subtitles.</p> <h2>Roadmap</h2> <h3>Milestone 1 - MVP</h3> <p class="svelte-piboub">The primary goal for Milestone 1 is to deliver a Minimum Viable Product
      (MVP). This includes, but is not limited to:</p> <ul><li><b>Core Subtitle Editing:</b>
        Creating, manipulating, and styling subtitles</li> <li><b>Audio and Video Playback:</b>
        Initially, a/v will be provided by
        <a href="https://github.com/FFMS/ffms2" class="svelte-piboub">FFMS</a>
        and subtitles by <a href="https://github.com/libass/libass/" class="svelte-piboub">libass</a>.
        This content will be rendered to the user using OpenGL and OpenALSoft.
        However, a plugin architecture will be used to allow for these options
        to be extended in the future.</li> <li><b>Tabs and Projects:</b>
        Ameko features tabs, allowing users to easily switch between multiple open
        subtitle files. Additionally, Ameko is introducing <i>Project Files</i>.
        Projects allow for logical grouping and organization of subtitle files
        independent of the physical filesystem structure, and provide a
        centralized place for common project configuration (like CPS warn
        levels, spellcheck language, etc.), colors, styles, and more.</li> <li><b>Integrated Git support:</b>
        Basic Git features, like committing, pulling, pushing, and blaming will be
        available out of the box.</li> <li><b>Scripting:</b>
        Ameko includes robust support for C# scripts and libraries. A scripting playground
        and support for simple JavaScript scriptlets will also be included.</li></ul> <h3>Future Milestones</h3> <p class="svelte-piboub">Ameko is envisioned as a comprehensive editing suite, and while the exact
      path is still unclear, future development will focus on significantly
      expanding its capabilities. Potential upcoming milestones include:</p> <ul><li><b>Audio Integration:</b>
        Implementing audio waveform/spectrum visualizations and related audio tooling.</li> <li><b>Graphical Tools:</b>
        Tools for visually manipulating subtitles on the video</li></ul></section> <footer class="foot svelte-piboub">Â© 2025 9volt.</footer>`;return{c(){e=u("main"),e.innerHTML=l,this.h()},l(i){e=c(i,"MAIN",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),p(e)!=="svelte-1erlych"&&(e.innerHTML=l),this.h()},h(){b(e,"class","svelte-piboub")},m(i,o){d(i,e,o)},p:t,i:t,o:t,d(i){i&&m(e)}}}class v extends n{constructor(e){super(),r(this,e,null,h,a,{})}}export{v as component};
